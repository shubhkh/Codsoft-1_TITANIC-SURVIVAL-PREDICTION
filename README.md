# Codsoft-1_TITANIC-SURVIVAL-PREDICTION
This repository contains a machine learning project that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not based on various features such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, and cabin.


Overview
The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. In this project, we utilize the Titanic dataset to build a predictive model that determines the survival of passengers based on their characteristics. This project is a classic example for beginners in machine learning and data science.

The project is divided into Jupyter notebooks for easy understanding and modularity:

Data Exploration: 01-data-exploration.ipynb

Initial data loading and exploration.
Visualizing data distributions and relationships.
Data Preprocessing: 02-data-preprocessing.ipynb

Handling missing values.
Encoding categorical variables.
Feature engineering.
Model Building: 03-model-building.ipynb

Selecting and training various machine learning models.
Hyperparameter tuning.
Model Evaluation: 04-model-evaluation.ipynb

Evaluating model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Prediction: 05-prediction.ipynb

Making predictions on new data.
Scripts
data_preprocessing.py: Contains functions for preprocessing the data.
model.py: Contains functions for building and training the machine learning models.
utils.py: Utility functions used across the project.
Results
The final model performance and predictions are stored in the results/ directory. Detailed evaluation metrics and model selection rationale are documented in the 04-model-evaluation.ipynb notebook.
